# E-Commerce using Laravel,php and vuejs

## steps

1. Via Composer Create-Project `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^8.0 Ecommerce`

2. installing laravel/ui package `composer require laravel/ui:^2.4`

3. Once the laravel/ui package has been installed, you may install the frontend scaffolding using the ui Artisan command:
// Generate login / registration scaffolding...
`php artisan ui vue --auth`

4. for compile Your fresh scaffolding run this command and run all mix tasks... `npm run dev`

5. should install laravel-mix package `npm install laravel-mix@latest` and re-run step 4

6. I have a problem that Node_Modules doesn't exist so I had to run this command `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server` and re-run step 4

7. I got this error `i Compiling Mix âˆš Mix: Compiled with some errors in 2.74s 1 WARNING in child compilations (Use 'stats.children: true' resp. '--stats-children' for more details) ERROR in ./resources/js/components/ExampleComponent.vue 1:0 Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0) You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders <template> <div class="container">  <div class="row justify-content-center"> webpack compiled with 1 error and 1 warning`

8. to solve it open file webpack.mix.js : and add this `mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js').vue().sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');`

9. Additional dependencies must be installes `npm install vue-loader@^15.9.7 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps` and re-run `npm run dev`

10. I got this error : `cannot find module 'webpack/lib/rules/descriptiondatamatcherruleplugin'`

11. to solve it Run this command `npm update vue-loader` and re-run `npm run dev`

12. finally Laravel Mix is compliled Successfully with `1 warning in child compilations (Use 'stats.children: true' resp. '--stats-children' for more details) webpack compiled with 1 warning`

13. you can keep going or try to fix this warning  by adding this to webpack.mix.js: `mix.webpackConfig({ stats: { children: true }});` after That we create our database and assign it in .env file

14. Run migrations `php artisan migrate`

15. register with any data :) . thats work 

16. rename welcome blade to product blade & in web.php change view welcome to view product 

17. write our product blade as we want :) as our assets in public folder :)

18. Now , we should create Product Model `php artisan make:model Product -mfs` m for migration ,f for factory, s for seeder :) 

19. Now, we need to create model for Cart `php artisan make:model Cart -m` 

20. create the field of Product Table and Cart Table

21. Now, We can run Migration :) `php artisan migrate`

22. lets use the factory to Generate some products :) . Open Product factory and in defintion function specify the type and  number of faker data you want in details with the help of this [FakerLibrary](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker)

23. in the product seeder , run factory to create products :)

24. in the database seeder file , we call the product seeder :) 

25. Now, create fillables in Product Model

26. run the seed `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

27. Database seeding completed Successfully

28. create ProductsController `php artisan make:controller ProductsController --resource`

29. in web.php , use this controller to render product view :) 

30. make Add To Cart button Vue component ,use it in product.blade.php. 

31. we don't see the button because we need to compile it so you should run this command `npm run dev`

32. I get this error `WARNING in ./resources/sass/app.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??clonedRuleSet-6[0].rules[0].use[1]!./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js??clonedRuleSet-6[0].rules[0].use[2]!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader/index.js??clonedRuleSet-6[0].rules[0].use[3]!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??clonedRuleSet-6[0].rules[0].use[4]!./resources/sass app.scss)Module Warning (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js): Warning(3474:3) autoprefixer: Replace color-adjust to print-color-adjust.

33. to solve this error, Irun this command `npm install autoprefixer@10.4.5 --save-exact` and re-run `npm run dev`

34. but still the button ddn't appear , because in app.js call app element , and if i search in product view, Cann't find this .

35. creating layout files 

36. after we pass userId and ProductId when the user click on Add To Cart button , we need to recompile `npm run dev`

37. install the toaster package to show the errors in smart way :) `npm install vue-toastr`

38. Every time I change in vue file , i need to recompile `npm run dev`

39. if the user is not logged in , show exception by toastr to make him login :) .

40. if the user is logged in, add product to cart by cart route

41. open web.php to add cart route :) 

42. add CartsController `php artisan make:controller CartsController --resource`

43. adding to cart processing using axios

44. add product in cart backend processing :) 

45. we have problem , the products don't added to cart even if user is logged in :(
